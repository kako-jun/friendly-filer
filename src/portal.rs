//! - [`Portal`]: a door to a subfolder. Walking in = `cd`; shooting it opens
//!   a folder-level operation menu (copy / move / delete / rename / archive).
//!   Its HP is the total recursive size of the subfolder (cached).
//! - [`Monolith`]: a blue-rimmed cube standing in the centre of every folder.
//!   Shooting it opens the *current folder's* operation menu — which is also
//!   where `new file` / `new folder` live.
//! - [`ParentGate`]: a back-ward line to `..`. Can't be shot; walking through
//!   it returns to the parent directory.
//!
//! Wiring up `cd` / folder operations is Issue #11. Here we only define the
//! data types and the dangerous-path guard used to decide which portals ship
//! with a seal.
